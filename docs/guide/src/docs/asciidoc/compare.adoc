[[_compare]]
= Compare

The `compare` command compares keys between a source and a target Redis database.

[source,console]
----
riot compare SOURCE TARGET [--mode <full|quick>]
----

The output looks like this:

----
Verification failed (type: 225,062, missing: 485,450)
----

missing::
Number of keys in source but not in target

type::
Number of keys with mismatched types (e.g. hash vs string)

value::
Number of keys with mismatched values

ttl::
Number of keys with mismatched TTL i.e. difference is greater than tolerance (can be specified with `--ttl-tolerance`)

There are 2 comparison modes available through `--mode`:

* Quick (default): compares key types and TTLs
* Full: compares key types, TTLs, and values

To show which keys differ, use the `--show-diffs` option.
